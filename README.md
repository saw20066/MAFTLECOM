🌐 MAF Telecom – Web Application

A full-stack web application developed for MAF Telecom to present the company’s services and manage products and orders through a secure admin dashboard.
This project was built as a real-world software engineering project, applying Agile methodology and modern ASP.NET development practices.

📖 Project Overview

MAF Telecom is a telecom and IT services company founded in 2022.
The goal of this project was to design and develop a functional, secure, and scalable web platform that supports both public users and administrators.

The application includes:

A public-facing website

User authentication and authorization

An admin area for managing products and orders

A database-driven backend using SQL Server

🧑‍💻 My Role

I worked on this project independently, handling the full development lifecycle:

Requirements analysis

Database design

Backend and frontend development

Testing and improvements

I followed Agile practices, managing my own backlog, iterations, and sprint reviews, treating the project as a real product rather than a simple academic assignment.
